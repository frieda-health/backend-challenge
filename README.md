# Rick & Morty - Backend Challenge

[RickAndMortyAPI.com](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) is a public API providing information to the series [Rick & Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty). The API provides information about *characters*, *locations*, and *episodes*.

## Your Task

Create a small web application that provides a dashboard showing all characters that played in the i-th episode of Rick and Morty order by the number of episodes the character played in. It should be easy to tell from the dashboard which character played in most episodes.

Use RickAndMorty's [REST API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest) to solve this challenge. The API is free to use and does not require an API key.

The challenge should be solved in `Kotlin`. Use a non-proprietary tech stack of your choice, docker to containerize the web application and explain in a readme how to run your solution. 

Please use version control (git is preferred).

## Submitting your solution

You have two options for submitting your solution:

1. Hosted repository (preferred)

Please email a link to a GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab/etc. repo to [thanh@frieda.health](mailto:thanh@frieda.health). If possible, keep the repository private, otherwise please **make sure to make the repository private after 3 days**.

2. Email

Alternatively, you can email your solution as a zip file to [thanh@frieda.health](mailto:thanh@frieda.health). Make sure to include the commit history in your submission.

## Evaluation

We want to use this challenge to understand how you would approach such a problem in a work setting.

Your submission will be evaluated a.o. based on:

- how you structure your application and your source code,
- how you name variables/functions/classes/packages,
- how you test your application and what kinds of tests you're writing,
- how you document your application, including instructions to run the project,
- what your commits look like,
- whether you know how to consume APIs efficiently,
- what tooling you use,
- overall consistency & attention to detail.

You should turn in a complete and runnable solution, but do not gold-plate it: we don't expect you to spend more than a few hours on this exercise.

In the technical interview that follows we would like to discuss your approach, and that includes talking about areas you would want to improve if given more time.

Note that the UI won't be part of the evaluation (could be plain HTML for instance).

## Have fun! ðŸš€

We look forward to your submission! Please [let us know](mailto:thanh@frieda.health) if you have any questions or concerns.
